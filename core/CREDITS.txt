Blacken was started by Steven Black <yam655@gmail.com> in 2010.

Version 1.0 was released under the GPL version 3 with Steven Black as the only
contributor.

On 2012-03-26, Blacken switched to the Apache 2.0 license for the development
of Blacken 1.1. It is hoped that by switching licenses, we can gain 
contributors.

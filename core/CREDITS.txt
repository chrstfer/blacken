The Current Team
================

Steven W. Black (yam655):

     Steven started programming so he could cheat at the DOS port of Moria in
     the 1980s. He's had a fondness for Roguelike games since that time. He
     likes to say that Roguelike games predate cursor keys on keyboards. In
     his youth he actually got to play Hack and Rogue on a dumb terminal
     without arrow keys as he had a dumb terminal in his bedroom connected to
     his father's Xenix/286 machine.

XLambda (xlambda):

     A devotee of roguelikes ever since his Nethack days. XLambda has played
     and enjoyed many different rogue-like games, and his studies in software
     engineering have reinforced his interest into developing them.

Shout-outs and Thank Yous
=========================

Steven would like to thank Robert Alan Koeneke (the creator of Moria) and
Jim E. Wilson (who made it available for DOS). Without Moria he very likely
would have never started programming seriously.

Blacken would like to thank the developers of LibTCOD -- located at
http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/ -- for redefining what is expected of
a Roguelike library and for giving us higher sights to set our goals upon.

A Brief History
===============

Blacken was started by Steven Black <yam655@gmail.com> in 2010.

Version 1.0 was released under the GPL version 3 with Steven Black as the only
contributor.

A patch release to fix a bug was released as 1.0.1 (again with Steven Black the
only contributor) and that was released under the LGPL version 3 to assist
folks with the move to the new license in 1.1.

On 2012-03-26, Blacken switched to the Apache 2.0 license for the development
of Blacken 1.1. It is hoped that by switching licenses, we can gain 
contributors.

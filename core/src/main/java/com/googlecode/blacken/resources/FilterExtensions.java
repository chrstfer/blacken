/**
 * A mostly case-insensitive extension filter.
 *
 * <p>Standard extensions are in US-ASCII and are favored to be in lowercase.
 * That is, they are defined to be in lowercase, so you can technically
 * ignore them if they're upper-case. Unfortunately, there are a lot of 
 * case-insensitive file systems, so this tries to be case-insensitive.
 *
 * <p>It uses the user's normal locale -- since the filenames should be
 * specified using the user's normal locale -- which means that for game
 * developers you can get unusual results unless you're consistently specifying
 * lowercase extensions.
 *
 * <p>Also note: This uses a Unix-centric definition of "extension", which
 * means that the period -- if required -- is to be considered a part of the
 * extension.

 * A simple one to one mapping factory.

 * <p>The advantage of an actual class, compared to a simple Map<D, T>
 * is that:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Returned items can be individually instantiated instead of cloned.
 * <li>An in-game location-based configuration can be taken in to account.
 * <li>A single simple type can result in various generated values.
 * </ul>

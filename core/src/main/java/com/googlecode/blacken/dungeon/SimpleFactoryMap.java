/**
 * Wrap a Map in a SimpleFactorylike.
 *
 * <p>While in the general case, a custom SimpleFactorylike will be best, in other
 * cases you can comfortably use an exact copy. These would be cases where you
 * use some sort of when-readonly-clone logic or when you just don't care if
 * you're dealing with the same reference in different locations (such as for
 * some terrain).
 *
 * <p>Note that this class does not clone the values -- it returns an exact
 * reference to them. It is only suitable for simple types and read-only
 * objects.

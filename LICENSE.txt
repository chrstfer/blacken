The license of Blacken Version 1.0.0 was the (plain) GPL v3.

The Blacken 1.0 line is the last release of Blacken to use any form of the GPL.
Future versions are moving toward the Apache 2.0 license.

This is a bug fix release for the 1.0 line, and so will stick with a GPL'ed 
license, however to facilitate the move toward the future of Blacken, this is
being released under the LGPL v3.

In accordance with the LGPL, copies of the GPL and LGPL are included named
COPYING-GPL.txt and COPYING-LGPL.txt. The LGPL builds upon the GPL so both
apply, but the LGPL provided some exceptions to rules set out in the GPL.

Thank you,
Steven Black
